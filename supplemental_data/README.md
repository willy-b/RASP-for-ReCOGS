# Analysis and Evaluation Notebooks

If GitHub is not showing a preview for the ipynb (depending on internet connection and availability they may not), you may download either the ipynb if you have Jupyter or the HTML version of each notebook provided and view that locally.

Alternatively, here are the links to the original notebooks on Google Colab as well:
